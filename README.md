# sns-resources
This repo contains the minimal working example of clustered setup of Tribefire including AWS infrastructure description and required EKS setup.

To create the cluster and install Tribefire in it please first follow instructions in [cluster.md](https://github.com/braintribehq/sns-resources/blob/main/cluster.md) to create the EKS cluster, then continue with the EKS cluster setup and Tribefire installation in [operator.md](https://github.com/braintribehq/sns-resources/blob/main/operator.md).

After the demo deployment is set up you can then [deploy ADx](https://github.com/braintribehq/sns-resources/blob/main/adx.md)
